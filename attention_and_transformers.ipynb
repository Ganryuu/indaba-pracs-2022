        "\n",
        "The transformer architecture, introduced in Vaswani et al. 2017 .'s paper Attention is All You Need, has significantly impacted the deep learning field. It has arguably become the de-facto architecture for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks; and can outperform benchmarks in various domains, including computer vision and reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers, as the title of the original paper implies, are almost entirely based on a concept known as attention. Attention allows models to \"focus\" on different parts of an input; while considering the entire context of the input versus an RNN, that operates on the data sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this practical, we will introduce attention in greater detail and build the entire transformer architecture block by block to see why it is such a robust and powerful architecture.\n",

        "- Learn how to use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library for quicker development cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Basic understanding of Jax and Haiku\n",
